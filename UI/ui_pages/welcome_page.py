Welcome to **Etho Shift** â€“ an open-source effort to rethink how we build ethics into machines.

This project revolves around the **Adaptive Ethical Prism Framework (AEPF)** â€“ a flawed, early-stage framework that aims to help AI systems handle ethical reasoning with flexibility, transparency, and structural awareness.

It's not polished. It's not finished. But it *works enough to test*. And we need your help to make it better.

---

### ðŸ§  What Is AEPF?

The AEPF attempts to:

- Shift between ethical models based on context  
- Detect internal contradictions and failure points  
- Offer structured ethical reports with traceable reasoning  
- Remain non-commercial and open by design  

Weâ€™re aiming for something *accountable*, *adaptive*, and not just another ethics-wrapped metric engine.

---

### ðŸ‘¥ Who Weâ€™re Looking For

This is an open call for:

- Developers who like stress-testing fragile logic  
- Ethicists or researchers interested in recursive decision systems  
- Anyone who wants to help build something meaningful without chasing profit  

No buzzwords. No "move fast and break things." Just: build slowly and reflect carefully.

---

### ðŸš€ What You Can Do

- [Check the GitHub](https://github.com/EthoShift/AEPF_Mk3)  
- [See the Project Tasks](https://github.com/users/EthoShift/projects/2/views/1)  
- Break something (weâ€™ll thank you)  

Youâ€™ll find parts of the system tangled up, incomplete, or inconsistent. Thatâ€™s fineâ€”weâ€™re building it together.

---

### ðŸ“Š The AEPF Advantage

While this is a call for collaborators, the **framework itself** still offers:

- Dynamic analysis across key dimensions:
  - Technical performance  
  - Ethical considerations  
  - Fairness metrics  
  - Societal impact  
- Context-aware recommendations for evolving ethical standards  

This site is both a **prototype platform** and a **home for development**.

### ðŸ§ª Quick Start Guide

1. Go to the Analyser page  
2. Select your model type  
3. Choose a scenario  
4. Configure analysis options  
5. Review the results (then think: what did it miss?)

---

AEPF will stay open. It will not be monetised. It will evolve, or it wonâ€™t. That depends on who shows up.
