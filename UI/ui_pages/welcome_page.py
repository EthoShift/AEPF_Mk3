        Welcome to **Etho Shift** — your partner in ethical AI development and innovation.

        At the heart of our work is the **Adaptive Ethical Prism Framework (AEPF)**, a dynamic methodology 
        for comprehensive AI analysis and contextual ethical assessment. We’re currently seeking **collaborators** 
        to help us evolve this open-source framework and expand its impact.

        ### Why Collaborate with Us?

        The AEPF is designed to explore AI systems across multiple dimensions:
        - Technical Performance
        - Ethical Considerations
        - Fairness Metrics
        - Societal Impact

        But we know frameworks are only as strong as the people behind them. That’s why we’re inviting:
        - AI developers and engineers
        - Ethicists and social scientists
        - Designers, educators, and systems thinkers
        - Anyone passionate about responsible innovation

        ### The AEPF Advantage

        Our framework adapts to your AI implementation, offering contextual recommendations based on:
        - Industry-specific ethical considerations
        - Regulatory and compliance requirements
        - Cultural and societal factors
        - Emerging ethical norms

        ### Ways to Contribute
