        ## Adaptive Ethical Prism Framework (AEPF)

        The **Adaptive Ethical Prism Framework (AEPF)** is a pioneering ethical decision-making system designed to evaluate and enhance the transparency, accountability, and fairness of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Developed by Leo M. Cole in 2024 in Harrogate, United Kingdom, AEPF provides a structured approach to assessing AI outputs across multiple ethical dimensions, ensuring their alignment with human values, societal well-being, and long-term sustainability.

        ### Overview
        AEPF operates as a modular framework, integrating various components to analyze and audit AI decision-making processes. Central to the framework is the **Ethical Governor**, which leverages a **Context Engine** and five distinct "prisms":

        1. **Human-Centric Prism**: Prioritizes individual rights and well-being.
        2. **Ecocentric Prism**: Focuses on environmental sustainability and ecological balance.
        3. **Sentient-First Prism**: Considers the ethical treatment of sentient beings, both human and non-human.
        4. **Innovation-Centric Prism**: Evaluates the impact of decisions on technological and creative progress.
        5. **Community-Centric Prism**: Advocates for the greater good and societal harmony.

        ### Key Features
        - **Ethical Scoring System**: A five-star grading system simplifies ethical evaluations for a broad audience.
        - **Transparency and Reporting**: AEPF supports four levels of reporting, from technical raw data to high-level summaries.
        - **Memory Component**: Enables the framework to retain and adapt based on past decisions.
        - **Modular Integration**: AEPF can audit or override existing AI systems.

        ### Applications
        AEPF has been applied in various domains, including:
        - **Healthcare**: Ensuring equitable treatment decisions.
        - **Finance**: Auditing AI models for loan default predictions.
        - **Human Resources**: Evaluating candidate selection processes.
